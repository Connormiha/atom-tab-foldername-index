## Why?
When you open several files with name `index.js`, you see many equal tabs with title `index.js` for different folders. It complicates the navigation.  
This extension fixes tab view if opened `index.*` file. Tab with `index` filename has double title (folder's name + file's name).  
Also it supports `__init__.py`, `__init__.php` files.
